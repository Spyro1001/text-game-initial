1|Bottom of the Well|You have reached the bottom of a deep and rather smelly well. Less than a foot of water remains, and it looks undrinkable.
2|Courtyard|At the centre of the courtyard is an old stone well. A strong and sturdy rope is attached to the well, and descends into the darkness. The only other items of interest are the farmhouse to the north, and a path to the east.
3|Farmhouse Entrance|The door to the farmhouse hangs crooked, and is slightly ajar. Obviously no-one has lived here for some time, and you can only guess at what lies within.
4|Blood-Stained Room|Dried blood stains can be seen on the walls and stone floor of the farmhouse. Whatever massacre occurred here long ago, you can only guess. With the absence of bodies, however, you may never know.
5|Long Windy Path|You are standing on a long, windy path, leading from the mountains in the far east, to a small farm that lies to the west.
6|Base of the Mountain|At the base of the mountain is a path that leads westward beyond a large boulder. Climbing such a mountain would be difficult - if not impossible.
7|Top of the Mountain|From this vantage point, you can see all that lies on the plains below. Large boulders dot the landscape, and just within view to the west you make out some sort of a building - though its details are too hard to make out from this distance.
8|Outside Castle|You are standing outside a rather large and obviously abandoned castle.  The drawbridge is up, but a cracked and broken door lays open headed downward into the castle dungeon.
9|Castle Dungeon|You enter a dimly lit room.  Along two of the walls, several skeletons lay slumped over and several more are chained to the wall.  It's apparent from the tracks on the ground that some kind of large animal has been here, but is now long gone.
